The SPORTS PLAYER BIO PROJECT starts off with a search screen where you are preasented with a Reset button and About button.

The user can click on the About button if they would like to read about the creator of the website or the reset button if they'd like to start all over.

The form on the screen will ask the user to type the First and Last name of the athlete they are looking to search.

When the first and last name are submitted, the suser will be promted to the data pertaining the athlete they inputed.

When the information appears, the user will be able to see the physical stats, places of origin, and even if they have social media accounts.  Not all athletes are the same, some prefer not to have social media and some do.  Some may have awesome photos on file and others prefer not to show a photo. The data will vary.

The user can continue to use the form to search new athletes or they can press the reset button and will be promted to the original screen.
