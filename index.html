    <h1>SPORTS PLAYER BIO PROJECT using thesportsdb API </h1>
    <h2>Richie Carrasco</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Proposal</h3>
    <p>I am a sports enthusist who wants to create an app where other sports 
    enthusits or anyone curious about sport players can search for their favorite players and learn about them in regards to their current professional status, personal stats and a brief summary about their life/career.
    Whether its the NBA, NFL or MLB, this search query will be able to provide all sorts of information about your favorite player.
</p>
   <p>Freddie is somone who loves sports but does not know much about soccer player, Lionel Messi.  Freddie can use the SPORTS PLAYER BIO APP to look up Messi and get familiar with him by learning about his place of birth and a short biography of the player. 
    The Sports Player Bio will be like the middleman connecting all, sports and non sports fan, to a player they are not familiar with so that they can learn more about sports players and thier background.
