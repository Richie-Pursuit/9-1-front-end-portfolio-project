##User Stories

I am a sports enthusist who wants to create an app where other sports 
    enthusits or anyone curious about an athlete can simply just for that person and learn about them in regards to their current professional status, personal stats and a summary about their life/career.  The user will also be able to see a photo of the athlete they choose to search up.
    Whether its the NBA, NFL, or even boxing, this app will be able to provide all sorts of information about your favorite player.

   Freddie is 21 and he somone who loves sports but does not know much about soccer player, Lionel Messi.  Freddie can use the SPORTS ATHLETE BIO APP to look up Messi and get familiar with him by learning about his place of birth, what team he plays for and a short biography of the player. Freddie wants to use the sports athelte bio app to familiarize himself with athletes he is not knowledgable of, that way he can have a general knowledge to talk about the athlete in social circles or fill a curiosity. 


    The Sports Player Bio will be like the middleman connecting all, sports and non sports fan, with information of an athlete they are not familiar with.
